# Privacy Preserving Deep Learning with PyTorch, PySyft & PyGrid

In this step-by-step tutorial series, you'll learn how PyGrid can be used to bring privacy and decentralization to a more realistic scenario (i.e., when data lives in a completely isolated environment). This tutorial series is continually updated with new features as they are implemented, and is designed for complete beginners.

These tutorials are organized as follows:
 - **/getting-started** - Go here if you have never heard about PyGrid, you'll learn the basics concepts (_coming soon_) .
 - **/data-centric** - Go here if you want to use PyGrid plattform from a data-centric perspective. See this [link](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid#data-centric-fl) for more detail (_in progress_).
 - **/model-centric** - Go here if you want to use PyGrid plattform from a model-centric perspective. See this [link](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid#model-centric-fl) for more detail (_coming soon_).

## Running the examples
Make sure you have [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed. We have prepared docker images that will install all the dependencies and help you run the PyGrid tutorials. Once you have `docker-compose` installed, clone this repository and run **`docker-compose up`** from your PyGrid root directory, after which you should see the address to the active Jupyter Notebook printed in your console. Click on the link to start using the examples. Notebooks can be run from [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html).

If you want, you can create your own `docker-compose` files using pre-built images from [docker-hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openmined).

And don't forget to star PyGrid on GitHub [https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid)!
