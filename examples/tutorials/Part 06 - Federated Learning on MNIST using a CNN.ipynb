    "# Part 6 - Federated Learning on MNIST using a CNN\n",

    "## Upgrade to Federated Learning in 10 Lines of PyTorch + PySyft\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context \n",
    "\n",
    "Federated Learning is a very exciting and upsurging Machine Learning technique that aims at building systems that learn on decentralized data. The idea is that the data remains in the hands of its producer (which is also known as the _worker_), which helps improving privacy and ownership, and the model is shared between workers. One immediate application is for example to predict the next word on your mobile phone when you write text: you don't want the data used for training — i.e. your text messages — to be sent to a central server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rise of Federated Learning is therefore tightly connected to the spread of data privacy awareness, and the GDPR in EU which enforces data protection since May 2018 has acted as a catalyst. To anticipate on regulation, large actors like Apple or Google have started investing massively in this technology, especially to protect the mobile users' privacy, but they have not made their tools available. At OpenMined, we believe that anyone willing to conduct a Machine Learning project should be able to implement privacy preserving tools with very little effort. We have built tools for encrypting data in a single line [as mentioned in our blog post](https://blog.openmined.org/training-cnns-using-spdz/) and we now release our Federated Learning framework which leverage the new PyTorch 1.0 version to provide an intuitive interface to building secure and scalable models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll use directly [the canonical example of training a CNN on MNIST using PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/mnist/main.py) and show how simple it is to implement Federated Learning with it using our [PySyft library](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/). We will go through each part of the example and underline the code which is changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also find this material in [our blogpost](https://blog.openmined.org/upgrade-to-federated-learning-in-10-lines).\n",

    "Of course, there are dozen of improvements we could think of. We would like the computation to operate in parallel on the workers and to perform federated averaging, to update the central model every `n` batches only, to reduce the number of messages we use to communicate between workers, etc. These are features we're working on to make Federated Learning ready for a production environment and we'll write about them as soon as they are released!\n",
